This is a C-sharp universal GUI program for converting
CBR to CBZ.  this program is multithreaded and has fairly good
robust validation before deleting the original CBR files.  It
supports drag and drop.  I've run this on my Linux desktop.

to compile this code

fork and/or download the source, then run below in a terminal

mcs -pkg:gtk-sharp-3.0 -out:cbr2cbz.exe CbrToCbzConverter.cs

once comilation is completed, run below in a terminal

mono cbr2cbz.exe

if running Linux below are the dependencies
mono gtk-sharp-3 unarchiver zip
